This app is a simple **Library Book** borrowing management project. It only has two main tables:
 - Books
 - Borrowers

The final app will let borrowers see the list of available books in the library and borrow some of them. This project is for learning purposes so none of these books, borrowers, or even the Library itself are real! You are very welcome to join our learning journey on this project and join our team. We are looking forward to making new friends!

## Project Goals
Goals of this project:
Practice teamwork and project management based on Scrum Framework.
Learn and practice various skills and tools.

## Project Description:
We are using server-client architecture for this project. For now! in the backend, we are using the WCF framework to create RESTful API by creating a self-hosted service (On Windows or Azure ServiceBus) and in the frontend, We are using React and Redux.  We are mainly using ReactBootstrap to style our project but some custom CSS is also being used.

üëª**Backend:**

We are using: C# as the main programming language. Since we are using WCF, our .Net Framework is set on v4.8 but for Entity Framework, we used EF Core Sqlite. For creating entities we did a Database First Approach design & Try to use and practice on various Design Patterns and DI, IoC, SOLID and etc. (more technical details are in the [backend folder](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/BookLibrary_WCF_React/tree/master/BookLibrary_Backend))
