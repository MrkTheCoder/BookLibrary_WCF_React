## Project Description:
The "Book Library" project is created based on an imaginary user story! Jane wants a website to manage her Library with these features:

- The list of books should have these items in each row:
  - Thumbnail of the book cover at the left and 2 text lines on its right side.
  - Book title in bold font.
  - ISBN code in normal font under it.
  - An icon to indicate if this book is available for borrowing or not.
  - When a user clicks on any book, a new page should open with the big image of the book cover along with other above items and the book description.
- Visitors can search between books based on ISBN/Book titles/Availabilities.
- Visitors can create an account for themselves or sign in.
