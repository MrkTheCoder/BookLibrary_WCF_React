### `More info`

  ### [actions](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/BookLibrary_WCF_React/tree/master/BookLibrary_Frontend/src/actions)  Folder :
Contains all the Redux actions, each API call has an action of it's own.
See the section about [Actions](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-2-concepts-data-flow) for more information.
`![Redux](https://img.shields.io/badge/redux-%23593d88.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=redux&logoColor=white)`



### [components](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/BookLibrary_WCF_React/tree/master/BookLibrary_Frontend/src/components) folder:

	
This folder contains all the components used in the project. i spitted components and screens into 2 different folders. components are the building blocks of a screen .


### [constants](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/BookLibrary_WCF_React/tree/master/BookLibrary_Frontend/src/constants) Folder: 
Some constants are being used in multiple places, as the project grows larger it gets harder and harder to manage them, this way we can manage them much easier and prevent any error caused by typos.

### [reducers](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/BookLibrary_WCF_React/tree/master/BookLibrary_Frontend/src/reducers) Folder: 
Same as actions folder, this folder contains Redux reducers more info can be found  [here](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-2-concepts-data-flow) .

### [screens](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/BookLibrary_WCF_React/tree/master/BookLibrary_Frontend/src/screens) Folder: 
screens are saved here, screens are main pages of the app, they are mainly constructed using [components](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/BookLibrary_WCF_React/tree/master/BookLibrary_Frontend/src/components) and some [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts) components.

### [stories](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/BookLibrary_WCF_React/tree/master/BookLibrary_Frontend/src/stories) Folder: 
I'm still learning this tool, it's one way of writing documentations for the project. more information can be found  [here](https://storybook.js.org/) .
